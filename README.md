# Hi, I'm Tyler Ramos 👋 

### Business Intelligence Analyst @ T-Mobile | M.S. Data Analytics: Data Engineering & Data Science 

I specialize in creating automated solutions that de-silo teams and foster cross-functional collaboration. By leveraging 
both low-code automation and end-to-end data standardization, I build reporting ecosystems that drive measurable business 
impact. Currently, I am expanding my expertise in Cloud Computing (Azure & GCP) to scale these solutions to the enterprise level.
